# Unveiling Crime Trends: Analyzing Major Crime Indicators in Toronto

<div align="center"> <h2>Introduction<h2> </div>

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to educate Torontonians about the frequency, distribution, and nature of various crimes occurring in their neighborhoods in a simple and accessible way. By analyzing the Toronto Police Service's Major Crime Indicators Open Dataset, I aim to present the data in a format that is easy for everyone to understand.

This project is designed to spark meaningful discussions about how to improve public safety measures and empower residents to make informed decisions about their safety. By presenting clear, straightforward insights, I hope to enhance community awareness and engagement.

### Overview of the Dataset
#### Link to original dataset: https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::major-crime-indicators-open-data/about

#### Source: 
This dataset was published by the Toronto Police Service through their Public Safety Data Portal, which provides public access to police datasets.

Some data may be excluded for legal, privacy, security, and confidentiality reasons. Additionally, all geographic data is adjusted to the nearest road intersection to protect privacy, so the locations are approximate and not tied to specific addresses or individuals. 

#### Description:
This dataset records occurrences of Major Crime Indicators (MCI) by reported date and related offenses. The MCI categories include Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery, and Theft Over $5000 CAD (excluding Auto Theft). It does not include incidents that were deemed unfounded or did not occur after police investigation.

As of the time of writing, the dataset includes MCI records up to the third quarter of 2024.
